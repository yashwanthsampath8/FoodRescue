	<p><b>What is food rescue ?</b></p>
	<p> Food rescue is the practice of collecting edible food that would have otherwise gone to waste from restaurants, grocers and other food establishments and distributing it to local hunger relief agencies. Food rescue is extremely effective because it simultaneously gets food to those who need it, reduces food waste, and minimizes the amount of toxic emissions from food waste in landfills</p>
	<p><b>What type of food does Food Rescue US rescue?</b></p>
	<p>Food Rescue focuses on the rescue of fresh, healthy food that is either excess inventory or is not marketable at retail due to nearing expiration dates or slight defects such as bruising or misshaping. Because we are uniquely able to deliver the food directly from the Food Donor to the Receiving Agency, we are able to provide access to fresh foods not typically accessible to food insecure families due to high cost and inconsistent availability.</p>
